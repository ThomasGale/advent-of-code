# [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
Turns out I'm really bad at solving these problems quickly...
Anyway, here are my stabs at the ones I've managed to solve.

## Build Notes
- Docker + VSCode + Dev Containers Extension
- Open folder in container (allowing Docker to build the devcontainer)
- `cmake -B./out .`
- `cd out/`
- `make`

## Executing
`*BUILD_OUTPUT*/Run/Run.exe "YEAR" "DAY"` (e.g. "2019" "5")

Turns out I'm really bad at solving these problems quickly...
Anyway, here are my stabs at the ones I've managed to solve.

## Build Notes
`CMakeSettings.json` is used by Visual Studio 2019's [cmake cross platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) functionality - which is what I'm using for my development environment.

## Executing
`*BUILD_OUTPUT*/Run/Run.exe "YEAR" "DAY"` (e.g. "2019" "5")
